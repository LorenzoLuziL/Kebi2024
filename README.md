The aim of this project is to develop a system that can intelligently filter and present menu items based on individual guest preferences. This involves representing detailed knowledge about the meals offered and the various dietary needs of guests. The knowledge base will include meal, such as pizza, pasta, and main courses, with each meal broken down into its constituent ingredients. These ingredients will be categorized (e.g carnivorous, vegetarian, omnivore) and will include nutritional information like calorie content and allergy.

Guests can have diverse dietary profiles: some may be carnivores, others vegetarians, some may be calorie-conscious, and some may have allergies (such as lactose or gluten intolerance). The system will cater to these profiles, enabling a personalized dining experience by displaying only those meals that align with the guests' preferences and dietary requirements.
In order to achieve this goal we defined knowledge-based solutions using differnt language like: Camunda, Prolog and Protégé to help with the selection task. With the ontolgy created during the definition of a knowledge-based solution we implemented an ontology-base meta-modelling solution.
